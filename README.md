# Chess Engine

This is a small chess engine written in Python. It is currently still a work in progress.

## Current features

The engine currently supports basic moves for all chess pieces, as well as capturing, both for pawns and major pieces (King, Queen, rook and bishop).

## Missing features

- The knight currently can neither move nor capture
- Captures are bugged
- En passant captures
- Castling

## Features planned down the line

### Improved AI

Currently, the AI just picks a random move each turn. This should be improved using a [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm and weighted squares with a priority on the centre of the chess board.

### Machine learning

With weighted square parameters being given to improve the positional play of the AI, it seems to be a logical next step to improve the AI using machine learning by combining random parameter adjustments with a genetic algorithm.
